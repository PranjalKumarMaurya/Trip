# Trip Multi-User Implementation Execution Package

## Status

- Package status: Accepted
- Package accepted: Yes
- Package lock complete: Yes
- Implementation Planning Freeze: Complete
- Implementation readiness review: Approved
- Implementation authorisation scope: IR-001 and bounded IR-002 only
- IR-001 authorised: Yes
- IR-001 status: Implemented and Verified
- IR-002 authorised: Yes — Implemented; independent verification pending
- IR-003 through IR-022 authorised: No
- W1 status: In progress; exit not achieved
- Application implementation: Not started

## Purpose

This package translates accepted architecture and design into implementation-ready execution units without changing accepted decisions, code, schema, policies, or design assets. It is a planning and traceability package only.

## Authoritative inputs

- accepted architecture package
- accepted Current UI Baseline
- accepted UI/UX design package
- implementation roadmap
- feature-parity contract
- migration plan
- security model
- design-to-roadmap mapping

## Package structure

The submitted Draft contains 47 required documents: 22 IR packets, seven Wave
documents, and 18 cross-cutting documents. Wave documents coordinate dependency
order and shared gates. IR packets define one reviewable implementation unit
each. Cross-cutting documents define repository inspection, change maps,
database/trusted-operation registers, security, tests, accessibility, rollback,
observability, environment boundaries, traceability, readiness, open items, and
change control.

The formal review added `gate-ledger.md` and `execution-package-review.md` as
review artefacts. Acceptance and lock are recorded in `acceptance-record.md`
and `lock-record.md`; neither record authorises implementation.

## Execution rule

- Waves execute in accepted dependency order.
- An IR packet may begin only after its entry gate passes.
- Packet completion requires its evidence and rollback conditions.
- No Wave bypass is permitted.
- W7 requires separate production authorisation.
- Acceptance of this package does not itself authorise deployment.

## Current next activity

Independently verify implemented IR-002 from its accepted bounded authorisation
record. It remains local-only and cannot satisfy GATE-011, authorise W2,
deployment, or cutover.
