# Implementation Execution Change Control

## Current baseline

- Execution package status: Accepted
- Execution package lock: Complete
- Planning freeze: Complete

## Controlled changes

Wave order, IR scope, repository change paths, database migration plan, RLS plan, trusted operations, design mapping, tests, rollback, R-02 requirements, and release gates require an explicit change record.

## Required record

- change ID and reason;
- affected Wave/IR, paths, DBM/TOP units, requirements, fixtures, and evidence;
- affected Gate IDs, security cases, tests, R-02 obligations, and rollback layers;
- architecture, design, security, migration, rollback, and release impact;
- reviewer/decision/status;
- traceability and open-item update.

## Rules

- No implementation executor may silently modify locked scope.
- Architecture-affecting changes use architecture change control.
- Design divergence uses accepted UI/UX design change control.
- Migration, RLS, trusted-operation, Storage, Realtime, and release changes require their specialist reviewers.
- A change cannot imply packet/Wave authorisation, implementation start, or W7 cutover authority.
- No locked change may be implemented before approval.

## CC-IR001-20260731 — Verification environment authority decision

- Decision authority: Product owner.
- Scope: IR-001 Evidence Foundation verification only.
- Authoritative execution environment: GitHub Actions on `ubuntu-22.04`,
  Node 22, Playwright 1.55.1, and Supabase CLI 2.105.0.
- Authoritative evidence: controlled browser failure and privacy transform,
  browser manifest, database normal/controlled-failure/recovery evidence,
  database manifest, durable exact Docker cleanup, and hosted artifacts.
- Accepted local limitations: the current local host uses Playwright's
  unsupported-host Ubuntu 20.04 fallback; controlled browser-failure staging
  screenshots are not consistently reproduced locally; exact local Docker
  resources can transiently reappear despite project-scoped stop before a
  final clean exact-resource state.
- Decision: those local limitations are non-blocking for IR-001 because the
  authoritative hosted browser and database lanes passed in run `30627419186`,
  their reviewed artifacts passed privacy/path/secret/allow-list/checksum
  checks, local unit/type/build and database assertions passed, final local
  exact-resource inspection was empty, no production or external Supabase
  resource was used, and `SEC-IR001-001` is closed.
- Boundaries: this decision establishes no general local-environment policy and
  does not authorise deployment, migration rehearsal, cutover, or IR-002.
- Rollback: revert this documentation-only decision and restore the previous
  IR-001 verification status surfaces; no implementation state is altered.
